\title{extract_split_info: Extract Split Information from Tree Structure}
\usage{
extract_split_info(tree, split_benchmark = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{(`list`)
A depth-based list of Node objects, typically produced by `convert_tree_to_list`.}

\item{split_benchmark}{(`data.frame` or `list`, optional)
Optional. A data frame or list containing split timing information, with columns `node.id` and `depth` (or similar). If provided, timing info will be merged into the output.}
}
\value{
(`data.frame`)
  A data frame where each row summarizes a node, including split feature, split value, statistics, and (if available) split timing.
}
\description{
Extracts split criteria, node statistics, and (optionally) split benchmark information from a tree structure.
This function traverses a depth-based list of Node objects and returns a data frame summarizing each node's split details, statistics, and (if provided) split timing.
}
\details{
This function is used internally by the gadgetTree framework to extract and summarize the structure and statistics of effect-based decision trees. It is useful for interpretation, reporting, and benchmarking.
}
\examples{
# Example: Extract split info from a fitted tree
pd_strat = pdStrategy$new()
tree = gadgetTree$new(strategy = pd_strat, n.split = 2)
tree$fit(effect, data, target.feature.name = "target")
split_info = tree$extract_split_info()
