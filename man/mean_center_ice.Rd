\title{Mean-center and Extract Effect Matrices for Features}
\usage{
mean_center_ice(effect, feature.set = NULL, mean.center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect}{(`R6` object or list)\cr
An object containing feature effect results, typically with
a `results` field. Usually produced by `FeatureEffect` or
similar functions.}

\item{feature.set}{(`character` or `NULL`)\cr
Optional. Subset of features to include. If `NULL`, all
features in the effect object are used. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{mean.center}{(`logical(1)`)\cr
Whether to mean-center the effect matrix for each observation.
Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
(`list`)\cr
  A list with the following elements (always lists, even for
  a single feature):
  \describe{
    \item{Y}{A named list of effect matrices (one per feature).}
    \item{grid}{A named list of grid values (column names) for each feature.}
  }
}
\description{
Processes feature effect results to produce a list of effect
matrices (Y) and their corresponding grid values for each
feature. Optionally mean-centers the effects for each observation.
}
\details{
If the effect results are in `data.frame` format, the function
pivots the data to wide format and mean-centers if requested.
If the effect results are a list, each element is processed similarly.
The grid contains the unique values (or bins) for each feature.
This function is typically used internally for preparing data for
effect tree construction and visualization.

\examples{
# Example usage (assuming 'effect' is an object with a 'results' field
# from FeatureEffect):
# result <- mean_center_ice(effect, feature.set = c("feature1", "feature2"), mean.center = TRUE)
# Y <- result$Y
# grid <- result$grid

}
